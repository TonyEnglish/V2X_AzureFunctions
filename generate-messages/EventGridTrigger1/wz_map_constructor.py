#   with known lat1, lat2.
#
#   See https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html for more detail.

#   from the vehicle path data lane.
#
#   lat1    = Latitude of origin
#   lon1    = Longitude of origin
#   bearing = Destination direction in degree
#   dist    = Destination distance in km

#   For Approach Lanes: starting from the ref. point go back upto 1st data point and construct map points for approach lane
#   For WZ lanes: starting from the ref. point process all points in pathPt array until the end
#
#   Equidistant Method: *** NOT USED *** -  Select data point for building the array by computing specified distance (for equidistance)
#                       between points for both approach and wz maps. This method does not work for map matching for curved lanes since the
#                       the data points may fall outside the map matching bounding box on curved lanes.
#
#   Rt. Triangle Method: *** IN USE *** - Points are selected based on change in heading angle which forms a rectangle triangle.
#                       A rt. angle triangle is formulated between two points. If the computed height is > half the lane width,
#                       the node point is selected for map node point and so on. This technique of selecting node point provides
#                       better map matching.
